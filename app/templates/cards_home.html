                Usually you are trying to think about ideas for people right? So sometimes it is good to start with a person and think of an idea for them.<br>
                <br>
                Take a card, on each card there is an image of a person and a name that describes their character. None of them are normal people but rather one of a range of unusual characters.<br>
                <br>
                Let your imagination go to work, how does the character on the card inspire you, what ideas can you think of?

                Ideas are almost always located in a place, correct?<br>
                <br>
                In this set of cards there are a wide range of different places and spaces, take a card and think what kind of ideas are inspired from that place. Maybe you can think of ideas specifically for that place, or the place on the card catalyzes a new idea.<br>
                <br>
                There are 48 cards most are everyday spaces, but one set of 6 cards are of extreme environments.

                These cards are useful when you know what it is you are thinking about (e.g. a new type of kettle, or a new type of banking service).<br>
                <br>
                Each of these cards has a different parameter on it, like price, weight, size, etc. Take a card and see if you can think of an idea that responds to that card.<br>
                <br>
                e.g. you pick a super low costs card and you are thinking of a new type of kettle - can you think of an idea for a $1 kettle?

                Ideas donâ€™t come from thin air - they need a seed. Especially if you want to generate and explore a super wide spectrum of ideas you need a stimulus to make your brain go there, these cards are just for that. <br>
                <br>
                These are a very diverse range of cards, each one has an image and a set of words on the back describing the image. Look at the image and/or look at the words and let your mind create ideas inspired by the cards.<br>
                <br>
                Rammo Jammo are great for creating ideas in the far corners of your creative space!
