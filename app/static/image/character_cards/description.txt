Usually you are trying to think about ideas for people right? So sometimes it is good to start with a person and think of an idea for them.

Take a card, on each card there is an image of a person and a name that describes their character. None of them are normal people but rather one of a range of unusual characters.

Let your imagination go to work, how does the character on the card inspire you, what ideas can you think of?
