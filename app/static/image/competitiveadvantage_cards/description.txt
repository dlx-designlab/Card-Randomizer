Sometimes in an idea generation session you need to explore a super wide spectrum of ideas, these cards are great for that.

These are a very diverse range of cards, each one has an image and a set of words on it - the words are connected to the image. Look at the image and / or look at the words and let your mind create ideas inspired by the cards.

Rammo Jammo are great for creating ideas in the far corners of your creative space!
