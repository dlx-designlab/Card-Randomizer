These cards are useful when you know what it is you are thinking about (e.g. a new type of kettle, or a new type of banking service).

Each of these cards has a different parameter on it, like price, weight, size, etc. Take a card and see if you can think of an idea that responds to that card.

e.g. you pick a super low costs card and you are thinking of a new type of kettle - can you think of an idea for a $1 kettle?
